# Creately Challenge - Find outlines of shapes
For a given image (transparent or white back ground), to find out the outline of the visible edges is little tricky since each and every pixel have to be assess to get a smooth result.

### Best solution
So far, the best algorithm to determine the outlines of an image is Marching squares algorithm.

There are lot of implementation of this algorithm hence I havenâ€™t tried to re-engage with the same solution. Below is the results of my effort and the working example is available.

### Workaround 
In this given solution, I have tried to scan an image canvas pixel by pixel and then determine which pixel to consider as an outline pixel. Instead of scanning the whole image, the algorithm is only scanning until finding a different pixel than the given based color which is reducing the performance cost.
The workaround was tested as a Java swing application and as a web page with JavaScript. 
Given html/js based example was develop as a final working solution.
  
 **NOTE:**_This example was purely based on html5, JavaScript and is using `easeljs-NEXT.js` library to draw canvas images and draw lines_ 
 
 ### Final Result
 
To manupulate the image outline via pixel scaning _`get_outline_shape_v1.0.js`_ was the final outcome. `draw_outliner.html` is the impletation of the working solution.

  - assets
    * `image-01.png`
    * `image-01-transp.png`
  - css
    * `examples.css`
    * `shared.css`
  - lib
    * `easeljs-NEXT.js`
    * `get_outline_shape_v1.0.js`
  - `draw_outliner.html`
 
 ### Steps to run
 
 - In the _`draw_outliner.html`_ file, _init()_ js function is initialising the image drawing in the two html canvases namely "imgCanvas" and "outlineCanvas".
 
 - _handleImageLoad()_ funtion is loading iniial given basic image into "imgCanvas" and then calling the _drawOutline(BASE_COLOR)_ fuction to get the outlines of the image as a shape object.
 
- IMG_BASE_COLOR_WHITE or IMG_BASE_COLOR_FULLY_TRANSPARENT are the currently available parameters to the _drawOutline()_. If we use fully transparent image in the init(), then use IMG_BASE_COLOR_FULLY_TRANSPARENT as the parameter and if we use image with a white background then use IMG_BASE_COLOR_WHITE.
