# Creately Challenge - Find outlines of shapes
For a given image (transparent or white back ground), to find out the outline of the visible edges is little tricky since each and every pixel have to be assess to get a smooth result.

### Best solution
So far the best algorithm to determine the outlines of an image is Marching squares algorithm.
>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_squares

There are lot of implementation of this algorithm hence I haven’t tried to re-engage with the same solution. Below is the results of my effort and the working example is available.

### Workaround 
In this given solution, I have tried to scan an image canvas pixel by pixel and then determine which pixel to consider as an outline pixel.

The solution was tested as a Java swing application and as a web page with JavaScript.

Working html/js solution file tree is as below,
  - assets
    * image-01.png
    * image-01-transp.png
  - css
    * examples.css
    * shared.css
  - lib
    * easeljs-NEXT.js
    * get_outline_shape_v1.0.js
  - draw_outliner.html
  
 **NOTE:**_This example was purely based on html5, JavaScript and was using easeljs-NEXT.js library to draw canvas images and draw lines_ 
 
 ### Final Result
 
 To manupulate the image outline via pixel scaning _get_outline_shape_v1.0.js_ was the final outcome.
 
 In the _draw_outliner.html_ file, _init()_ js function is initialising the image drawing in the two html canvases namely "imgCanvas" and "outlineCanvas".
 _handleImageLoad()_ funtion is loading iniial given basic image into "imgCanvas" and then calling the _drawOutline(BASE_COLOR)_ fuction to get the outlines of the image as a shape object.
